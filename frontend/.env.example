# Polling Intervals (optional - auto-configured based on NODE_ENV)
# All values in milliseconds, or "false" to disable polling
# If not set:
#   - Development: Fast intervals (10-15s) for quick feedback
#   - Production:  Conservative intervals (45-90s) for bandwidth efficiency
#
# Smart polling automatically stops when data can't change:
#   - Players: Only poll in ZeroPhase (list locks after game starts)
#   - Commits: Only poll in CommitPhase (locks in RevealPhase)
#   - Votes:   Only poll in RevealPhase (hidden before, locked after)
#   - Rounds:  Only poll in active phases (CommitPhase/RevealPhase)
#   - Winners: Never poll (static historical data)
#
# See src/lib/polling-config.ts and docs/SMART_POLLING_OPTIMIZATION.md

# Individual Query Polling (fine-grained control)
# ============================================================================
# Each query can have its own interval. If not set, falls back to defaults:
#   - Players → POLL_GAME_WAITING (polls during ZeroPhase only)
#   - Commits → POLL_GAME_ACTIVE (polls during CommitPhase only)
#   - Votes   → POLL_GAME_ACTIVE (polls during RevealPhase only)
#   - Rounds  → POLL_GAME_ACTIVE (polls during CommitPhase/RevealPhase)

# Commits polling (when CommitPhase)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_COMMITS=45000
