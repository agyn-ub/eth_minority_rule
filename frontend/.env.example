# =============================================================================
# REQUIRED: Polling Intervals Configuration
# =============================================================================
# All core polling intervals MUST be set (app will crash if missing)
# Values: positive integers in milliseconds OR "false" to disable
# Min: 1000ms (1 second), Max: 300000ms (5 minutes)
#
# Recommended values:
# - Development: 10000-15000ms for quick feedback
# - Production: 45000-90000ms for bandwidth efficiency
#
# Smart polling automatically stops when data can't change:
#   - Players: Only poll in ZeroPhase (list locks after game starts)
#   - Commits: Only poll in CommitPhase (locks in RevealPhase)
#   - Votes:   Only poll in RevealPhase (hidden before, locked after)
#   - Rounds:  Only poll in active phases (CommitPhase/RevealPhase)
#   - Winners: Never poll (static historical data)
#
# See src/lib/polling-config.ts for detailed documentation
# =============================================================================

# Active phases (CommitPhase/RevealPhase) - REQUIRED
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_ACTIVE=45000

# Waiting phase (ZeroPhase) - REQUIRED
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_WAITING=60000

# Completed games - REQUIRED (recommend: false to disable)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_COMPLETED=false

# Active games list - REQUIRED
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAMES_ACTIVE=45000

# Completed games list - REQUIRED
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAMES_COMPLETED=90000

# =============================================================================
# Optional: Fine-grained control (falls back to main intervals if not set)
# =============================================================================
# Each query can have its own interval. If not set, falls back to:
#   - Players → POLL_GAME_WAITING (polls during ZeroPhase only)
#   - Commits → POLL_GAME_ACTIVE (polls during CommitPhase only)
#   - Votes   → POLL_GAME_ACTIVE (polls during RevealPhase only)
#   - Rounds  → POLL_GAME_ACTIVE (polls during CommitPhase/RevealPhase)

# Players list polling (when ZeroPhase)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_PLAYERS=60000

# Commits polling (when CommitPhase)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_COMMITS=45000

# Votes polling (when RevealPhase)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_VOTES=45000

# Rounds history polling (when CommitPhase/RevealPhase)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_GAME_ROUNDS=45000
